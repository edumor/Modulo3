# OpenZeppelin Wizard Project

## Overview
This project is a simple Ethereum smart contract project created using OpenZeppelin Wizard. It includes a Solidity smart contract, deployment scripts, and test cases to ensure the contract functions as intended.

## Project Structure
```

├── contracts
│   └── MyContract.sol       # Solidity smart contract
├── scripts
│   └── deploy.js            # Deployment script for MyContract
├── test
│   └── MyContract.test.js    # Test suite for MyContract
├── package.json              # npm configuration file
├── hardhat.config.js         # Hardhat configuration file
└── README.md                 # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Compile the Contracts**
   To compile the smart contracts, use the following command:
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

3. **Deploy the Contract**
   To deploy `MyContract` to the Ethereum network, run:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
   ```
   Replace `<network_name>` with the desired network (e.g., localhost, rinkeby).

4. **Run Tests**
   To run the test suite for `MyContract`, execute:
   ```
   npx hardhat test
   ```

## Usage
Once deployed, `MyContract` can be interacted with using its public functions. Refer to the contract code in `contracts/MyContract.sol` for details on available functions and their usage.
